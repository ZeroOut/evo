#EVO by klokare

This a Go implementation of NeuralEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). From the NEAT F.A.Q.

NEAT stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. It is a method for evolving artificial neural networks with a genetic algorithm. NEAT implements the idea that it is most effective to start evolution with small, simple networks and allow them to become increasingly complex over generations. That way, just as organisms in nature increased in complexity since the first cell, so do neural networks in NEAT. This process of continual elaboration allows finding highly sophisticated and complex neural networks.
